# Tasks of Hexlet

📍 Here are the solutions to the tasks that I solved while studying at the [Hexlet online programming school](https://ru.hexlet.io/).

The tasks are divided by topics in the directory.
* [Arrays in JavaScript](https://github.com/Zubkov99/HexletTasks/tree/master/arrays)
* [Function in JavaScript](https://github.com/Zubkov99/HexletTasks/tree/master/function)
* [Objects in JavaScript](https://github.com/Zubkov99/HexletTasks/tree/master/objects)
* [Testing JEST](https://github.com/Zubkov99/HexletTasks/tree/master/hexlet-jest)

📐 The condition of each task is written at the beginning of each file. All tasks are solved in JavaScript.
